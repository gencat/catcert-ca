CATCert-ca
==========

Installation of the CA certificates used by the Catalan Certification Agency (http://www.catcert.cat) in Debian GNU/Linux based distributions.

The package also installs an autogenerated certificate that was used to sign applets and Java WebStart apps of the JClic project until December 2013. Newer versions of JClic (http://clic.xtec.cat) are currently digitally signed with a CATCert certificate, but old versions may require it.

The resulting package "ca-certificates-catcert" is distributed and updated by the JClic team from its PPA repository in Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~jclic/+archive/master

This package is based on the Debian package "ca-certificates-local", included in ca-certificates. For more information about ca-certificates-local see the directory /usr/share/doc/ca-certificates/examples/ca-certificates-local in http://packages.debian.org/sid/ca-certificates
